By :-
* Neeraj Gopalakrishnan
## About
The purpose of this project is to implement the main core components of Hadoop's Map Reduce Framework. Three types of operations were worked on during this project, they are :-
1. WRITE : Given an input file, split it into multiple partitions and store it across multiple worker nodes.
2. READ : Given a file name, read the different partitions from different workers and display it to the user.
3. MAP-REDUCE : Given an input file, a mapper file and a reducer file, execute a MapReduce Job on the cluster.
### Procedure to run the code :- 
1. Git Clone the Url - **git clone** **https://github.com/Projects-RR-2022/BD1_814_824_830_831**
2. Install File Split - **pip install file split**
3. To run the Framework, go to the master file and run the **start-all.py** file
4. To run the Operations, go to the client file and run the **client_v1.py** file
